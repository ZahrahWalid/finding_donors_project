# finding_donors_project
The project of machine learning cross-skilling nanodegree program provided from Udacity.

In this project, I've employed several supervised algorithms to _accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census_. My goal is **to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000**. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations. Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand 
* how large of a donation to request, or 
* whether or not they should reach out to begin with. 
While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can **infer this value from other publically available features**.
